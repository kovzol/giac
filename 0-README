Hi,
this is an experimental version of Giac.
It aims to have a simple, consistent build system to compile the newest version of Giac for modern architectures.

For a stable version see GeoGebra's repository https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/browser/trunk/geogebra/giac.
Giac's main homepage is at https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html
and mostly developed by Bernard Parisse.

This repository is maintained by Zoltán Kovács.
